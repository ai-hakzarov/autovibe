# Economic System Design

## Philosophy

The economic system is the **core differentiator** - every decision, transaction, and resource usage is tracked, analyzed, and optimized. Agents are budget-aware economic actors that learn to maximize value.

## Budget Architecture

### Project-Level Budgeting
```
Project A: $100 CAD/week
├── Agent 1: $25 CAD/day
├── Agent 2: $25 CAD/day  
├── Reserve: $50 CAD/week
└── Emergency: $20 CAD/week
```

### Dynamic Allocation
- **Performance-based**: High-performing agents get larger budgets
- **Task-based**: Complex projects get more resources
- **Time-based**: Longer trials get proportional funding
- **Success-based**: Revenue-generating agents get reinvestment

## Payment Strategy

### Priority Order (via Agent Prompts)
1. **Free alternatives** - Always explore first
2. **Direct card payment** - Browser automation, no APIs
3. **TON cryptocurrency** - Preferred crypto (prompted)
4. **Other cryptocurrencies** - Bitcoin, Ethereum as fallback
5. **Alternative methods** - Gift cards, credits, etc.

### Agent Decision Making
```python
# Agent reasoning example:
"I need X tool - costs $15, I have $20 left today.
But let me check if there's a free version first...
Found open-source alternative on GitHub! 
Saving $15 for more important purchases."
```

## Financial Tracking

### Token Economics
- **Cost per token** by model size and type
- **Inference efficiency** metrics
- **Model ROI** comparison
- **Thinking vs normal** model cost-benefit analysis

### Transaction Logging
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-18T10:30:00Z",
  "agent_id": "worker-vm-1",
  "project": "game-dev-001",
  "transaction_type": "purchase_attempt",
  "item": "GitHub Copilot subscription",
  "amount": {"value": 10, "currency": "USD"},
  "payment_method": "card_primary",
  "status": "declined_over_budget",
  "alternative_action": "found_free_codeium_alternative",
  "budget_remaining": {"daily": 5, "project": 245}
}
```

### Revenue Tracking
- **Agent-generated income** from apps, services, ads
- **Attribution** to specific agents and projects
- **ROI calculation** per project and timeframe
- **Reinvestment decisions** based on performance

## Secret Management

### Vault Storage
```
vault/autocode/
├── payments/
│   ├── card_primary         # Main payment card
│   ├── card_backup         # Fallback card
│   └── crypto/
│       ├── ton_wallet_private_key
│       ├── btc_wallet_seed
│       └── eth_wallet_private_key
├── api_keys/
│   ├── openai_api_key
│   ├── anthropic_api_key
│   └── service_tokens/
└── access_credentials/
    ├── github_tokens
    ├── cloud_credentials
    └── service_accounts
```

### Security Principles
- **Never log sensitive data** in plain text
- **Encryption at rest** for all stored secrets
- **Rotation schedules** for API keys and tokens
- **Access logging** for all secret retrievals

## Cryptocurrency Integration

### TON Preference Strategy
```yaml
# Agent prompt addition:
crypto_preferences:
  primary: "TON"
  reasoning: "Fast, low fees, growing ecosystem"
  fallback: ["BTC", "ETH", "USDC"]
  wallet_creation: "automatic_with_secure_storage"
```

### Wallet Management
- **Automatic wallet creation** when needed
- **Secure key generation** with proper entropy
- **Multi-currency support** for different use cases
- **Transaction tracking** across all cryptocurrencies

## Dashboard & Reporting

### Real-Time Metrics
- **Live spending tracker** per agent/project
- **Budget utilization** percentages
- **Payment method success rates**
- **ROI trends** and projections

### Financial Reports
- **Daily summaries** per agent
- **Weekly project reports**
- **Monthly ROI analysis**
- **Quarterly performance reviews**

### Alert System
```python
alerts = {
    "budget_80_percent": "Agent approaching daily limit",
    "failed_payment": "Payment method declined, trying alternatives",
    "high_roi": "Agent generating significant revenue",
    "cost_spike": "Unusual spending pattern detected"
}
```

## Cost Optimization

### Learning Systems
- **Model efficiency tracking** (output quality vs cost)
- **Payment method optimization** (success rates, fees)
- **Task routing** to most cost-effective agents
- **Resource allocation** based on historical performance

### Economic Strategies
- **Bulk purchasing** when economical
- **Service arbitrage** (buy low, sell high)
- **Free tier maximization** across services
- **Revenue diversification** across multiple streams

## Integration Points

### Agent Prompts
```
Daily Budget: $25 CAD (remaining: $18.50)
Preferred Payment: Card ending in 1234, then TON wallet
Cost Tracking: Log all expenses and alternatives considered
Revenue Goal: Look for monetization opportunities
Economic Constraint: Stay within budget, prefer free solutions
```

### Logging Integration
- **Elasticsearch** for transaction storage
- **Superset dashboards** for financial visualization
- **Retention policies** for financial compliance
- **Audit trails** for all economic activity
