```

### Security & Compliance

#### Security Architecture
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSM)** or cloud key management services for payment credentials
- **HashiCorp Vault** with automatic secret rotation and access policies
- **OAuth 2.0 + JWT** authentication for all API endpoints
- **Rate limiting** and DDoS protection on all financial endpoints
- **TLS 1.3** encryption for all data in transit
- **AES-256** encryption for sensitive data at rest

#### Access Control
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with principle of least privilege
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all administrative access
- **API key rotation** every 30 days for external integrations
- **Session management** with automatic timeout and invalidation

#### Compliance Framework
- **KYC/AML compliance** for crypto trading operations
- **GDPR/CCPA compliance** for data collection and processing
- **SOC 2 Type II** controls for financial data handling
- **PCI DSS** compliance for card payment processing
- **Regular security audits** and penetration testing quarterly

#### Monitoring & Incident Response
- **SIEM integration** for real-time threat detection
- **Automated fraud detection** with ML-based anomaly detection
- **24/7 security monitoring** with alert escalation procedures
- **Incident response playbook** with defined roles and procedures

### Payment Integration
```python
# Payment cascade implementation
payment_methods = [
    "free_alternatives",    # Always try first
    "card_primary",        # Main payment card
    "ton_wallet",          # Preferred crypto
    "btc_wallet",          # Bitcoin fallback  
    "eth_wallet",          # Ethereum fallback
    "alternative_methods"   # Gift cards, credits
]
```

## Risk Management

### Economic Risks
